## 1. Weighted Evaluation Script
This script calculates performance based on the specific weights provided in the project brief: Accuracy (40%), Precision & Recall (30%), F1-Score (20%), and Latency (10%).


import time
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

def calculate_weighted_score(y_true, y_pred, latency_per_ticket):
    # Calculate base metrics
    acc = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    # Precision & Recall are grouped as 30% [cite: 37, 40]
    prec = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    rec = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    
    # Latency Score: Typically 1 / latency (Lower is better) [cite: 47, 48]
    # Here we assume a normalized score for latency
    latency_score = 1.0 if latency_per_ticket < 0.1 else 0.5 

    # Weighted Calculation [cite: 35]
    final_score = (
        (acc * 0.40) + 
        (((prec + rec) / 2) * 0.30) + 
        (f1 * 0.20) + 
        (latency_score * 0.10)
    )
    
    return {
        "Final Weighted Score": round(final_score, 4),
        "Accuracy (40%)": acc,
        "Precision/Recall (30%)": (prec + rec) / 2,
        "F1 (20%)": f1,
        "Latency Score (10%)": latency_score
    }

## 2. Organizing Data & Model Access

To make final model and data "easily accessible" , use the following structure in your Git repository:

/models/: Place your serialized model here (e.g., classifier.pkl). This is your Trained ML Model deliverable.


/data/: While the prompt mentions historical tickets, you should include a sample_data.csv or a script to download the dataset if it's large.


requirements.txt: Ensure it includes Python 3.8+ and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, NLTK/SpaCy, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.

## 3. Methodology Report (Deliverable)
Technical Documentation must explain addressed the following categories:

Bug Report: Software defects.


Feature Request: User suggestions.


Technical Issue: Specialized troubleshooting.


Billing Inquiry: Invoices and payments.


Account Management: User profiles and access
